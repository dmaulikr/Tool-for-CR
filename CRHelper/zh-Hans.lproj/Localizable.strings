"Besides Super Magical Chests, chests are not determined by chance, they are determined by a cycle.

The cycle does not advance if you have no empty chest slots. You must have a chest slot open to get the next chest and move forward in the cycle.

There are 180 Silver Chests, 52 Golden Chests, 4 Magical Chests and 4 Giant Chests in the 240 chests cycle.

Super Magical Chests are the only chests given by chance, which is 0.2%. And it will replace the one in the cycle." = "除了超级神奇宝箱，其它宝箱掉落不是随机的，它们是由你在宝箱循环的位置决定的。
            
如果你4个宝箱空位槽满了，你的宝箱循环不会进位，即使你赢的了一场对战。
            
目前宝箱循环表里总共有180个白银宝箱，52个黄金宝箱，4个神奇宝箱，4个巨型宝箱总共240个宝箱组成。
            
超级神奇宝箱是唯一一个由运气决定的，它的掉落几率是0.2%，同时它会取代你原本要从宝箱循环里得到的宝箱。
